#### 1. [Hello DevNet Create!](/01-HelloDevNetCreate__definition_workflow_01RGVDI3KMSTE7EWiOzBB40pkcEfdc7CNWv)

This is a sample workflow that hits an API server that returns a JSON response with a number of fake 'user' objects with their metadata, parses that response to extract 'names' of users, and sets a list of those 'names' in the workflow's output variable.

However, since this workflow is being committed to the Dev Branch that has our [AutoDoc](https://github.com/ciscomanagedservices/sxo-autodoc) GitHub Action setup, you're going to be able to see this description in the branch's README automatically!
