## DevNet Create 2021 - LT06: Building Stability, Performance &amp; Scale into SecureX Orchestration Workflows

[About DevNet Create 2021](https://developer.cisco.com/devnetcreate/2021) | [**Link to Session Presentation**](https://github.com/ciscomanagedservices/devnet-create-2021/raw/main/00-DVNT21-LT06.ppsx)

There are **three** branches in this repository:

1. `main`: This is the default branch. If you're reading this, you're in the `main` branch. Workflows used to demonstrate concepts in the lightning talk are available here:
    1. [Hello DevNet Create!](/01-HelloDevNetCreate__definition_workflow_01RGVDI3KMSTE7EWiOzBB40pkcEfdc7CNWv): A simple workflow to make an API Request to jsonplaceholder.typicode.com, parse the response & set an output variable with the parsed response
    2. **Breadcrumbs (Logging & Tracing Framework)**

        > For original code & documentation, please visit [ciscomanagedservices/sxo-utilities](https://github.com/ciscomanagedservices/sxo-utilities) & review the section on "Breadcrumbs"
        1. [(Logging) Hello DevNet Create!](/02-Logging-HelloDevNetCreate__definition_workflow_01RGVOR5L9C334UpTjF9kCWnsAuCldUQJfm/): Added Breadcrumbs Logging Blocks after each activity to capture progress of the preceeding activity. Also added `/garbage` to the 'Relative URL' of the web service request activity to introduce an intential failure that's captured by Breadcrumbs.
        2. [(Tracing) Hello DevNet Create!](/03-Tracing-HelloDevNetCreate__definition_workflow_01RGWNB3HROTQ25NFgF7IRrU7eXDdh2kpYs/): A simple workflow to read from the `All My Breadcrumbs` table and provide a JSON response with the stack trace captured above.
    3. **Oversight (Error Handling & Alerting Framework)**

        > For original code & documentation, please visit [ciscomanagedservices/sxo-utilities](https://github.com/ciscomanagedservices/sxo-utilities) & review the section on "Oversight"
        1. [(With Error) Hello DevNet Create!](/04-WithError-HelloDevNetCreate__definition_workflow_01RHRLZAY87LA06dyNiURM5Dmfrdeb9MxfS/): Added `/garbage` to the 'Relative URL' of the web service request activity to introduce an intential failure
        2. [(Error Handler) Hello DevNet Create!](/05-ErrorHandler-HelloDevNetCreate__definition_workflow_01RGW22SQVLYI4XiZljNv8KMmxVRdh5zhPV/): A simple workflow to notify via a text to a Webex space when an error occurs
    4. [Import from GitHub](/06-ImportFromGitHub__definition_workflow_01R8FL4PGG7AT69i8rPD2vtpJPVi0ByVMI8/): A workflow that triggers off notifications of new commits to the `prod` branch and pulls down the committed workflow into the Org. 

        > Please note that this workflow is intentionally limited for demonstration purposes & may not import all workflow dependencies. 'Watch' the [ciscomanagedservices/sxo-utilities](https://github.com/ciscomanagedservices/sxo-utilities) repository to be notified when this workflow supports additional capabilities.
2. `dev`: This branch contains the Dev workflow (a copy of the "[Hello DevNet Create!](/01-HelloDevNetCreate__definition_workflow_01RGVDI3KMSTE7EWiOzBB40pkcEfdc7CNWv)" workflow) & GitHub Actions ([AutoDoc](https://github.com/ciscomanagedservices/sxo-autodoc) & [Analyzer](https://github.com/ciscomanagedservices/sxo-analyzer)) used to demonstrate Continuous Integration & Deployment (CI/CD).
3. `prod`: This branch contains the Prod workflow (pushed from the `dev` branch) & a GitHub Action to dispatch an email on commit to a mailbox that [this import workflow](/06-ImportFromGitHub__definition_workflow_01R8FL4PGG7AT69i8rPD2vtpJPVi0ByVMI8/) on our Production Org monitors. This is the branch our Production Org pulls from.

Please note that workflow content & GitHub Actions in this repository will not be kept up to date with new code releases/patches. Please refer to the original repositories (linked above where applicable) for updates. If you're a DevNet Create 2021 attendee, you may create an issue on this repository or reach out to us via email for queries and/or feedback.
