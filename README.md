There are three branches in this repository:

1. `main`: This is the default branch. If you're reading this, you're in the `main` branch. Workflows used to demonstrate concepts in the lightning talk are available here.
2. `dev`: This branch contains the Dev workflow & GitHub Actions ([AutoDoc](https://github.com/ciscomanagedservices/sxo-autodoc) & [Analyzer](https://github.com/ciscomanagedservices/sxo-analyzer)), used to demonstrate Continuous Integration & Deployment (CI/CD).
3. `prod`: This branch contains the Prod workflow. This is the branch our production SecureX Orchestration Org pulls from.
